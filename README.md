# R37URN0 Calculator - Basic Arithmetic Calculator Application



The **R37URN0 Calculator** is a straightforward yet powerful arithmetic calculator application developed by Team R37URN0. This application allows users to perform essential arithmetic operations on two operands, delivering a convenient tool for swift calculations.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two operands.
- User-friendly interface for easy and intuitive interaction.
- Clean and cohesive design, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Components

### MainActivity.kt

The `MainActivity.kt` file serves as the primary entry point of the application. It houses the core logic for capturing user input, processing arithmetic operations, and displaying the results. The file acts as the bridge between user actions and the underlying calculation processes.

### ThemeViewModel.kt

In the `ThemeViewModel.kt` file, you'll find the ViewModel responsible for managing the visual theme of the application. This ViewModel provides a centralized location for handling color schemes, fonts, and styling elements, thus enabling the creation of a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing design.

### AppViewModel.kt

The `AppViewModel.kt` file contains the ViewModel that coordinates various aspects of the application's behavior and data flow. This ViewModel ensures the separation of concerns and maintains a smooth interaction between the UI and underlying logic.

### ui/theme/Color.kt

The `ui/theme/Color.kt` file defines the color palette used throughout the application. This includes defining colors for backgrounds, buttons, text, and other UI elements. By centralizing color definitions, the file facilitates consistent and coordinated theming.

### ui/theme/Theme.kt

Inside the `ui/theme/Theme.kt` file, you'll encounter the core theme definition. This file consolidates various styling elements such as colors, typography, and spacing, shaping the overall visual identity of the application.

### ui/theme/Type.kt

The `ui/theme/Type.kt` file focuses on typography-related settings, including font choices, sizes, and styles. Typography significantly impacts user readability and experience, and centralizing these settings ensures a cohesive look and feel.
